# Questions about our Advanced Python Programming

This repo has no code. We just use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues).

![Example question](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/872296/11227477/f9c0f846-8d64-11e5-825a-1cc1024ed08c.png)

**Example question:** [How to create a dictionary from a list of tuples?](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues/1)

## How to ask a question

To ask a question you have to [submit a new issue](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues/new). **Please make sure your question is not already answered by [searching for the issue](#searching-for-questions) beforehand**. If it hasn't been asked yet please go ahead and create a new one.

If you're currently participating in one of our courses you can set labels to provide more details about your question. The types of labels you can use are:

 * Topic
 * Type of question
 * Class

#### Topic

The topic you're asking about. It's preceded by a letter `t`. Example: `t-lists`, `t-data-types`, `t-iterators`.
This makes it simple to search by a specific topic. For example, let's search for `t-lists`: [https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/labels/t-lists](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/labels/t-lists).

There's a **huge list** of topics. So **make sure you use the `t-` prefix while creating/searching for issues**.

#### Type of question

Is your question a genuine question? Or you're having an error and you need help to debug it? These are preceded by the letter `s`. Here's the list of question types, please be precise when defining the question type:

  * `s-question`: Standard question: _how can I build a dictionary from a list of tuples?_
  * `s-error`: Your code doesn't work. You're having an error.
  * `s-help-needed`: More general. You're having issues and you need help.

#### Class

Just add the number of the class so we can go through that in the next class. Example, if you're reading topics for `class-3` that will take place next week, add the `class-3` label.

Example, adding topics to your question while you're creating it:

## Searching for questions

Github issue tracker is a powerful search tool. You can filter by label and do standard full-text search. By default all questions that have been answered will be [marked as closed](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
Make sure you specify the right labels. Example:

## Examples

  * Searching resolved questions (status=closed) that are about lists: [?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3At-lists](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3At-lists)
  * Searching open questions for `class-2`: [?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aclass-2](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aclass-2)
  * Searching for open questions about `t-strings`, from `class-1` that have the `title` text in it: [?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3At-strings+label%3Aclass-1+title](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3At-strings+label%3Aclass-1+title)
