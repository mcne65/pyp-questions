# Questions about our Advanced Python Programming

This repo has no code. We just use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues).

## How to ask a question

To ask a question you have to [submit a new issue](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues/new). **Please make sure your question is not already answered by [searching for the issue](#searching-the-issue) beforehand. If it hasn't been asked yet please go ahead and create a new one.

If you're currently participating in one of our courses you can set labels to provide more details about your question. The types of labels you can use are:

 * Topic
 * Type of question
 * Class

#### Topic

The topic you're asking about. It's preceded by a letter `t`. Example: `t-lists`, `t-data-types`, `t-iterators`.
This makes it simple to search by a specific topic. For example, let's search for `t-lists`: [https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/labels/t-lists](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/labels/t-lists).

There's a **huge list** of topics. So **make sure you use the `t-` prefix while creating/searching for issues**.

#### Type of question

Is your question a genuine question? Or you're having an error and you need help to debug it? These are preceded by the letter `s`. Here's the list of question types, please be precise when defining the question type:

  * `s-question`: Standard question: _how can I build a dictionary from a list of tuples?_
  * `s-error`: Your code doesn't work. You're having an error.
  * `s-help-needed`: More general. You're having issues and you need help.

#### Class

Just add the number of the class so we can go through that in the next class. Example, if you're reading topics for `class-3` that will take place next week, add the `class-3` label.

## Searching for questions

Github issue tracker is a powerful search tool. You can filter by label and do standard full-text search. By default all questions that have been answered will be [marked as closed](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-questions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
Make sure you specify the right labels. **TODO: Example and Screenshot**.
